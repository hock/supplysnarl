€ Tweet Peter Clack ; @PeterDClack Human life can not continue without electricity. This is not a supply chain issue. Cutting power will end all modern life. No internet. No heating. No cars. No food. An alliance is already banning oil drilling. This is not about carbon dioxide. Once oil & coal end. Life ends. 5:28 PM - Nov 11, 2021 - Twitter for Android 458 Retweets 28 Quote Tweets 1,038 Likes QO VQ g wy Angela.
