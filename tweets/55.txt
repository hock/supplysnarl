Bc | have shopped through the last year and toys have ALWAYS been in stock. Only thing that wasn’t was toilet & handsoap. Which makes me wonder about that too! Do they want us to get sick from wiping our butts & NO _/ tof O1 a O1 “ © #somemom @Mamacannabis! - 20h ooo | went last in June- toys were overflowing. Dont they usually have more toys by now for Christmas? Section isn't larger and shelves are very low stock, very low. Elk River Walmart both times....why would they purposely do this?
