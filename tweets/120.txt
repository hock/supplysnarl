Ce The Sardonic Patriot @Mayflower_21 The proposed mileage tax. If you drive 20,000 miles in a year you owe $1,600.00. Imagine what that would do to the trucking industry and the already shaky supply chain for business. Biden promised to only raise taxes on the wealthy. This would be a tax on ALL drivers but would only negatively impact the poor. Â® Better contact your reps. Just to put this in perspective, if you drive 26,000 miles X 0.08 per mile = $2,080.00. [now get mad]. BIDEN TAX INCREASES phew * PER-MILE USER FEE * ESTIMATED TO BE 8 CENTS PER MILE * AMOUNTS VARY DEPENDING ON VEHICLES     )Dseewrs NEWSMAX.
